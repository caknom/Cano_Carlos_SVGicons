# Interactive SVG Icons Assignment
Each Student must build a branded, scalable themed icon set using Adobe Illustrator. Export each icon from Illustrator as an SVG. Use the SVGs as assets on the FIP/Brand Revival site (think icons for different flavours or ingredients). Add some simple interacDvity with JavaScript. Use HTML (and the appropriate elements) to include a descripDon of the icon set.

## Requirements
Use Terminal, Git and Github to create the project structure and a linked repository. Create a minimum of 6 SVG icons in Illustrator. Use CSS to organize the icons on an HTML page (products)in your FIP. You can choose how you want to implement this - as an image tag source, as an SVG tag, or using the object tag.
Use CSS interacDons or transiDons to change the icon’s appearance (on hover, as an example, reverse all of the colours or add a drop shadow, etc). When clicked log a message to the console with the ID of the element that you’ve clicked. The ID should be retrieved and displayed with a JavaScript string template and variable (refer to the class example).
Push the finished files to your repo; include a readme that describes the project. Merge everything to the main branch and submit a link to the dropbox on FOL - a .txt file is fine.
